Filmovi


This is web application for watching movies for free without ads (school project)


*
Application have very little backend so if you want to run it:
1.Download XAMPP and run Apache and MySQL
2.On phpmyadmin make data base with name "film"
3.Then make table with name "korisnici"
4."korisnici" have 4 columns: "id", "korisnickoime", "email", "lozinka"
5.When all that is finished, run the app.py file from cmd by typing "app.py" in that directory
6.copy and paste localhost url in your browser, you will need to register and login, and WOALA you can watch plenty of movies
*

!IMPORTANT!
*
DO NOT use this website for watching movies no-stop. This is representative website of my work, you have plenty of websites and desktop apps 
watching movies online without ads like Stremio,Rokr and more.

Reason is because i used free API to catalog all movies so i have limited requests per month so be resonable because im sharing my API key to you

Enjoy!
